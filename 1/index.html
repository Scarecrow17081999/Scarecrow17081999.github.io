          <h2>Ecommerce Website</h2>
          <div>
            I successfully built an e-commerce website using a powerful tech
            stack comprising React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Leveraging
            these technologies, I implemented essential features such as a

            seamless order processing, efficient product search, and convenient
            pagination for browsing through extensive product catalogs.
            Additionally, I designed an engaging homepage to captivate visitors
            and implemented a detailed product detail page to provide
            comprehensive information. To streamline operations, I developed an
            intuitive admin panel enabling administrators to effortlessly add
            new products and efficiently manage existing ones. With this
            comprehensive e-commerce solution, I have demonstrated my ability to

            Meesho clone, a platform that replicates the functionalities of the
            popular social commerce app. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            we crafted a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Our
            clone incorporated key features such as a user-friendly shopping
            cart for seamless product selection and ordering, a secure login
            system, and an efficient product search mechanism. The homepage was
            carefully designed to showcase products attractively and engage
